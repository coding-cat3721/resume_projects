## Cache Lab Report Analysis

# Level 1
	- Cache unfriendly pattern: Accessing memory column by column in an array of array
		- [Description] By accessing column by column, instead of row by row, the cache
		does not contain the values that are next to the first value found.
		- [Fix] This was fixed by accessing the memory in the array of arrays
		consecutively by iterating through each row first before continuing to
		the next row.

# Level 2
	- Cache unfriendly pattern: Accessing memory column by column for specific
	locations in memory (diagonals of the array of arrays)
		- [Description] This is similar to above, except that iterating through
		the whole array, we only target specific values, namely along the
		diagonal.
		- [Fix] By seeing that the array given is a mirrored array, and as such
		A[i][j] == A[j][i] for all j,i. This means that we can abuse this
		property, and sum up along the rows to the same effect as summing
		up the columns, which is faster due to the cache already having those
		row values.
		
# Level 3
	- Cache unfriendly pattern: Swapping positions column by column entry by column entry
		- [Description] Instead of utilizing spatial locality, the unoptimized
		algorithm would end up shifting by columns.
		- [Fix] We fix this by making the swaps occur within the same row before
		moving to the next row. This causes the swaps to actually utilize cache
		memory, instead of going to main memory every time it iterates through
		an array.

# Level 4 (Honours)
	- Cache unfriendly pattern: Inefficient sorting algorithm
		- [Description] The algorithm sorts the array utilizing bubble sort,
		which is a sorting algorithm that is alright on small arrays, but
		becomes very inefficient on large arrays, taking O(n^2) time
		complexity.
		- [Fix] We fix this by implementing another sorting algorithm that
		has the capabilities of sorting through a large array faster.
		For the purposes of this array, we used mergesort to implement
		the cache optimization. Time complexity is O(n*log(n)), which is
		much better than before.
