Language(s): Assembly language (ASM), hexadecimal-encoding 

## Description
A programme to purposely simulate a malicious actor attempting to gain control
of a system by an application of a buffer overflow attack upon a given executable 
file.

## Executing steps
There are four different levels of difficulty in this lab, and as such each level of 
difficulty has their own exploit code.

`.exploit` files are the hexadecimal commands that we have converted from ASM to hexadecimal 
for our overflow attack.

`.raw` files are the actual graphical representation of those hex commands when displayed 
(mostly gibberish looking), and are always autogenerated from the `.exploit` files

### To generate a `.raw` file from a `.exploit` file
```sh
./hex2raw < some_exploit_level.exploit > some_exploit_level.raw
```
E.g. To generate level 1: `Sparkler`:
```sh
./hex2raw < sparkler.exploit > sparkler.raw
```

### To execite a `.raw` file against the executable
After the raw file is generated, it can then be run against the given executable
```sh
./bufbomb -u net_id < some_exploit_level.raw
```
E.g. Running our sparkler exploit against the executable
```sh
./bufbomb -u jy1299 < sparkler.raw
```

When the correct raw file is generated, tested locally, and is successful, 
it can then be sent to the scoring server with the `-s` flag

E.g. Running and sending the sparkler exploit to the server
```sh
./hex2raw < sparkler.exploit > sparkler.raw
./bufbomb -u jy1299 -s < sparkler.raw
```

## Project Outcomes
- Executed C programmes completely from the commandline

- Learned programme profiling techniques via `gdb`

- Used the commandline to generate exploit input files (generated by converting ASM commands to hexadecimal code)

- Showcased a detailed understanding of IA-32 calling conventions, and the stack organisation of C programmes

- Implemented a buffer overflow attack
